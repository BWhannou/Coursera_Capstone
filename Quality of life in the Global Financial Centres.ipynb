Some of those services are:\n\n* Banking services (commercial, investments, securities exchanges)\n* Insurance\n* Tax planning\n* Fund management\n\nThe Financial Institutions (FI) that populate those areas have on their liabilities, funds from suppliers located in various part of the world. Moreover, their counterparties (to whom they lend money, for example) are indistinguishable between resident and non-resident. In other words, on both sides of their balance sheet, the external exposure has a higher weight than the domestic one. The IMF (International Monetary Funds) defines three categories of FC:\n\n* **International Financial Centres (IFC)**: are large international **full-service** centers with **advanced settlement and payments systems**, supporting large domestic economies, with deep and liquid markets where both **the sources and uses of funds are diverse**, and where legal and regulatory frameworks are adequate to safeguard the integrity of principal-agent relationships and supervisory functions.\n\n* **Regional Financial Centres (RFC)**: differ from the first category, in that they have developed financial markets and infrastructure and intermediate funds in and out of their region, but have relatively small domestic economies.\n\n* **Offshore Financial Centres (OFC)**: can be defined as a third category that are mainly much smaller, and provide more limited specialist services.\n\nSo according to this definition, three traits make a Financial Centre: full-service, advanced settlement and payments systems and a high diversity of the sources and uses of funds. From this definition, we can already identify some IFC and RFC. On one hand, London, New York and Tokyo would be classify as IFC. On the other hand, Hong Kong (\u9999\u6e2f) and Singapore (\u65b0\u52a0\u5761) would be classify as RFC due to their small domestic economies. However, given the "
